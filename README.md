US Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

A Python program that allows users to interactively explore US bikeshare data from Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
The program filters the dataset based on user selections and provides detailed statistics about travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics.

 Project Description

The bikeshare.py script provides an interactive way to analyze bikeshare data from three major US cities.
Users can choose:

A city (Chicago, New York City, Washington)

A month (January–June or "all")

A day of the week (Monday–Sunday or "all")

The program then loads the corresponding dataset and displays:

Most frequent travel times

Most popular stations and trip combinations

Total and average trip durations

User statistics

Optionally: raw data in 5-row increments

This project demonstrates Python data analysis using Pandas, NumPy, and real-world datasets.
